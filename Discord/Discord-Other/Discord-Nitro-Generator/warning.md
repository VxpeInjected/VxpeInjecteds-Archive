# ⚠️ WARNING

## Why This Is Pointless

This generator picks **random 16-character codes** from 62 possible characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).  
That means there are:

``47672401706823533450263330816`` possible combinations.  

Even if you could check **1,000,000 codes every second**, it would take:

``1,510,647,251,591,488 years`` (1.5 Quintillion Years)

on average to find a single valid code.  
This is astronomically longer than the age of the universe (≈13.8 billion years).

## Read Before Using

This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
It demonstrates how a Discord Nitro code generator might be structured, but does **not** bypass Discord security.

---

## Terms of Service

Brute forcing Nitro codes is **strictly against Discord's Terms of Service**.  
Attempting to use this against real Discord servers could get your account **suspended** or **banned**.

## Educational Use Only

This code exists to show:

- How Python can generate random strings  
- How HTTP requests work  
- How multithreading can be used in Python  

It is not meant to be used maliciously or to gain free Nitro.
